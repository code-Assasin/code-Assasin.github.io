	abstract     = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various computer vision tasks. However, their robustness often falters in real-world scenarios where images are subject to diverse forms of corruption. Prior approaches to address this vulnerability typically involve computationally expensive techniques such as data augmentation and test time adaptation. In this study, we propose an alternative solution focused on image pre-processing at test time to mitigate the impact of common corruptions. Our approach introduces a novel image processing algorithm called EREN (\textbf{E}nhanced \textbf{R}ecognition based on \textbf{E}dge \textbf{N}uances), specifically designed to cater to DNNs. Unlike traditional image processing methods that are primarily tailored for human visual perception, EREN enhances the high-frequency edge information that standard DNN models favor in recognition tasks. The key advantage of EREN is its differentiability, which enables fast and efficient image pre-processing. We evaluate the effectiveness of EREN across multiple datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, and the Tiny-ImageNet-C. Our results demonstrate that EREN boosts model accuracy on corrupted data while preserving performance on clean data. Overall, our study highlights the potential of model-centric image processing techniques like EREN to provide a promising pathway for enhancing the robustness and efficiency of DNNs in real-world applications.}
